# CIFAR-100 Classification Using Logistic Regression and CNN

This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. It compares the performance of **Logistic Regression**, **Logistic Regression with PCA**, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.

## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts to:
- Train models on the CIFAR-100 dataset using Logistic Regression and CNN.
- Compare accuracy between Logistic Regression (with and without PCA) and CNN.
- Save and load a trained CNN model for predictions.

Additionally, the project includes a script to predict the class of an image using the trained CNN model.

## Dataset

The [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is used for this project. It contains 60,000 images of 32x32 pixels across 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

- Training Samples: 50,000
- Testing Samples: 10,000
- Labels: 100 fine-grained classes such as **apple**, **aquarium_fish**, **baby**, etc.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Logistic Regression
A baseline classification model applied to the flattened CIFAR-100 images.

### 2. Logistic Regression with PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of the images, improving performance for Logistic Regression.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A deep learning model with layers of:
- Convolutional and Pooling layers
- Batch Normalization
- Dropout for regularization
- Fully Connected Layers for classification

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.8+
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar100-classification.git
   cd cifar100-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_models.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the CNN model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_cnn.py
   ```

## How to Use the Pre-trained Model

### 1. Save the Model
The trained CNN model is saved as `cifar100_cnn_model_improved.h5`. 

### 2. Load the Model
Use the following code to load the model:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('cifar100_cnn_model_improved.h5')
```

### 3. Predict the Class of an Image
Use the script `predict_image.py`:
```bash
python predict_image.py --image_path <path_to_image>
```

## Results

| Model                      | Test Accuracy  |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression        | 17.98%         |
| Logistic Regression + PCA  | 18.66%         |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | **45.13%**  |

The CNN significantly outperformed Logistic Regression methods.
